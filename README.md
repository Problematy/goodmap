# Good Map

Map engine to serve all the people ;) 

## Setup

Use python 3.10, install poetry: `pip install poetry` and then install dependencies: `poetry install`

## Running App locally

### TL;DR
If you don't want to go through all the configuration, e.g. you just simply want to test if everything works,
you can simply run app with test dataset provided in `tests/e2e_tests` directory:

> poetry run flask --app 'goodmap.goodmap:create_app(config_path="./tests/e2e_tests/e2e_test_config.yml")' run

### Configuration

If you want to serve app with your configuration rename config-template.yml to config.yml and change its contents according to your needs.
Values descriptions you can find inside config-template.yml.

Afterwards run it with:
> poetry run flask --app 'goodmap.goodmap:create_app(config_path="/PATH/TO/YOUR/CONFIG")' --debug run

## Database

Database consists of three sections:

- `categories` - which informs on what categories data of points is divided
- `visible_data` - list of categories which will be visible by application users
- `data` - actual data split into `categories`


### `categories`
Fully configurable map where key is name of category and value is list of allowed types. E.g.
* "car_elements": ["mirror", "wheel", "steering wheel"]
* "color": ["red", "blue", "green"]

### `data`
Data consists of two parts:
* obligatory and constant
  * `name` - name of the object
  * `position` - coordinates of object
* category dependent - depending on your `categories` setup it varies. See example of config below.

#### `custom data`
You can define your own, more complex data types as dictionary.
* obligatory fields in dictionary:
  * `type` - type of data
  * `value` - value of data
* optional fields in dictionary:
  * `displayValue` - value to display instead of `value`

## Examples

You can find examples of working configuration and database in `tests/e2e_tests` named:
- `e2e_test_config.yml`
- `e2e_test_data.json`
